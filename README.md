# mxpak

Mendix package manager and workspace deduplicator with global caching and hard links.

Download each widget once, cache it globally, and share it across all your projects at zero extra disc cost. Then deduplicate the rest of the shared assets (libraries, theme resources) in one pass.

## How it works

mxpak has two complementary mechanisms, both backed by the same content-addressable store at `~/.mxpak/store/{sha256}/`:

1. **`mxp install` — widget dependency manager.** Downloads `.mpk` files from the Mendix Marketplace, stores them in the CAS by SHA-256 hash, and hard-links them into `<project>/widgets/`. Locked via `mxpak.lock` for reproducibility.
2. **`mxp scan` — workspace deduplicator.** Scans every project under a workspace, hashes shared files that `install` doesn't manage (Java libraries in `userlib/`/`vendorlib/`, Mendix standard theme assets in `themesource/`), and replaces duplicates with hard links to a single CAS-stored copy.

If the cache and project are on different drives (where hard links don't work), mxpak falls back to a regular file copy automatically.

## Install

**Prerequisite** — Erlang/OTP 26+ must be on `PATH` (`escript` command available).

- macOS: `brew install erlang`
- Windows: `winget install Erlang.ErlangOTP`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install erlang` (or your distro's equivalent)

### Release binary

Download `mxp` from the latest GitHub release, make it executable, and place it
on `PATH`.

```sh
install -d "$HOME/.local/bin"
curl -fsSL \
  https://github.com/glendix-labs/mxpak/releases/latest/download/mxp \
  -o "$HOME/.local/bin/mxp"
chmod +x "$HOME/.local/bin/mxp"
```

The `mxp` asset is an Erlang escript and can also be run explicitly with
`escript /path/to/mxp`.

Arch Linux users can install the `mxpak-bin` AUR package after its initial AUR
publication. Maintainer setup and release automation are documented in
`AUR_PUBLISHING.md`.

### Troubleshooting

- **`escript: ... command not found`** — Erlang/OTP is missing. Install it via
  the prerequisite step above.
- **`mxp: command not found`** — ensure the install directory, such as
  `$HOME/.local/bin`, is on `PATH`.
- **`undefined function mxpak:main/0`** — download the current `mxp` release
  asset again.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/glendix-labs/mxpak.git
cd mxpak
gleam run -m gleescript    # produces ./mxpak — rename to mxp and place on PATH
```

## Usage

```
mxp <command> [options]
```

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `install [project_root]` | Resolve and install all widgets from config (lock file preferred) |
| `add <name> --version <v>` | Add a widget to config and install |
| `remove <name>` | Remove a widget from config |
| `update [name]` | Update widget(s) (clears lock, re-resolves) |
| `marketplace [project_root]` | Interactive TUI browser for the Mendix Marketplace |
| `outdated [project_root]` | List widgets with available updates |
| `list [project_root]` | List installed widgets |
| `info <name>` | Show widget details |
| `audit [project_root]` | Verify SHA-256 integrity of all installed `.mpk` files |
| `cache clean` | Clean the global cache |
| `scan [path]` | Deduplicate `*.mpk`, `*.jar`, and `themesource/**` across all projects under the workspace |
| `status [path]` | Show per-project deduplication stats and disc savings |

## Configuration

Add a `[tools.mxpak]` section to your project's TOML config:

```toml
[tools.mxpak]
mode = "mpk"
widgets_dir = "widgets"

[tools.mxpak.widgets.Badge]
version = "3.2.2"
id = 50325

[tools.mxpak.widgets."com.mendix.widget.web.Datagrid"]
version = "2.22.3"
id = 116540
```

Running `mxp install` generates a lock file (`mxpak.lock`) that pins exact versions and SHA-256 hashes for reproducible builds.

## Workspace deduplication

`mxp scan` auto-detects what to scan based on where you run it:

```sh
# Case 1 — inside a single Mendix project (a `*.mpr` is in the directory):
cd ~/Mendix/TSVE4HMC-main
mxp scan         # scans this project only
                 # its assets are absorbed into the global CAS at ~/.mxpak/store/
                 # future scans of any other project automatically dedup against them

# Case 2 — a directory whose immediate children are Mendix projects:
cd ~/Mendix      # contains TSVE4HMC-main/, ChartTest/, Blank/, ...
mxp scan         # scans every Mendix project (every immediate subdir with `*.mpr`)

mxp status       # works the same way (single project or workspace)
```

If neither case matches (no `*.mpr` here, none in immediate children), `scan` exits with a clear hint.

### Default rules (zero-config)

`scan` works with sensible defaults out of the box — no setup file required:

| Rule | Default value |
|---|---|
| `include` | `["*.mpk", "*.jar"]` — widgets and Java libraries (`widgets/`, `userlib/`, `vendorlib/`) |
| `include_dirs` | `["themesource"]` — Mendix standard theme modules (atlas_core, datawidgets, etc.); all extensions scanned under these directories |
| `exclude_dirs` | `["deployment", "javascriptsource", "javasource", "modules", ".mendix-cache", ...]` — build artefacts and project-unique code |

`scan` and `install` share the same CAS at `~/.mxpak/store/`. Widgets installed via `mxp install` are already hard-linked into the cache, so `scan` over them is effectively a no-op. Widgets that Mendix Studio Pro placed directly are absorbed into the CAS on the first `scan` and deduplicated thereafter.

### Customising

Drop a `.mxpak-workspace.toml` in your workspace root to override any of the above:

```toml
[scan]
include      = ["*.mpk", "*.jar", "*.zip"]
include_dirs = ["themesource", "shared"]
exclude_dirs = [".git", "deployment"]
```

Missing keys fall back to defaults.

### Measured savings (16 real Mendix projects, ~23 GB total)

`mxp scan` covers everything below in one pass:

| Target | Total | After dedup | Saved | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `widgets/*.mpk` | 804 MB | 533 MB | **270 MB** | 33.6% |
| `*.jar` in userlib/vendorlib | 534 MB | 222 MB | **311 MB** | 58.3% |
| `themesource/**` | 57 MB | 15 MB | **42 MB** | 74.0% |
| **Combined** | **1,395 MB** | **770 MB** | **623 MB** | **44.7%** |
